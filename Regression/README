# Linear Regression Analysis in R

This repository contains R code for performing simple and multiple linear regression analysis on the "mtcars" dataset using the "ggplot2" and "dplyr" libraries.

## Description

- **Data**: The code loads the "mtcars" dataset and randomly samples 20 rows for analysis.

- **Simple Linear Regression**:
  - It performs simple linear regression between the "wt" (weight) and "mpg" (miles per gallon) variables.
  - Calculates the correlation value between "wt" and "mpg."
  - Generates a simple linear regression model and provides a summary.
  - Creates residual plots, a histogram of residuals, and a Q-Q plot for model evaluation.

- **Multiple Linear Regression**:
  - It extends the analysis to multiple linear regression, considering both "wt" and "gear" variables as predictors.
  - Provides a summary of the multiple linear regression model.
  - Generates residual plots, a histogram of residuals, and a Q-Q plot for model evaluation.

## Usage

You can run the R code provided in this repository to perform linear regression analysis on the "mtcars" dataset. Make sure to have the necessary R packages ("ggplot2" and "dplyr") installed.
