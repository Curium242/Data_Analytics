# Linear Regression Analysis of mtcars dataset in R

This repository contains R code for performing simple and multiple linear regression analysis on the "mtcars" dataset using the "ggplot2" and "dplyr" libraries.

## Description

- **Data**: The code loads the "mtcars" dataset and randomly samples 20 rows for analysis.

- **Simple Linear Regression**:
    -It performs simple linear regression between the "wt" (weight) and "mpg" (miles per gallon) variables.
    -Calculates the correlation value between "wt" and "mpg."
    -Generates a simple linear regression model and provides a summary.
    -Creates residual plots, a histogram of residuals, and a Q-Q plot for model evaluation.

- **Multiple Linear Regression**:
    -It extends the analysis to multiple linear regression, considering both "wt" and "gear" variables as predictors.
    -Provides a summary of the multiple linear regression model.
    -Generates residual plots, a histogram of residuals, and a Q-Q plot for model evaluation.

##Output
  The script generates:
    -Linear regression model summaries
    -Residual plots
    -Histogram and Q-Q plot for residuals
    -Correlation value between variables
