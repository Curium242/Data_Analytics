# NYC Flights 13 Analysis in R

This repository contains R code for analyzing the "nycflights13" dataset using the "nycflights13" and "dplyr" libraries.

## Description

- **Data**: The code loads the "nycflights13" dataset, specifically the "flights" dataset, which contains information about flights departing from New York City in 2013. A sample of 30 rows is randomly selected for analysis.

- **Data Summarization**:
  - Three dataframes (`df1`, `df2`, and `df3`) are created to summarize flight information for carriers, flights, and tail numbers, respectively. These summaries include the mean arrival delay for flights with delays exceeding 30 minutes.

- **Data Exploration**:
  - Basic data exploration is performed, including:
    - Viewing the dataset.
    - Summarizing the dataset.
    - Extracting variable names.
    - Computing summary statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and quantiles) for the "distance" variable.
    - Finding the index of the maximum and minimum distances.

## Usage

You can run the R code provided in this repository to perform exploratory data analysis on the "nycflights13" dataset. Make sure to have the necessary R packages ("nycflights13" and "dplyr") installed.
